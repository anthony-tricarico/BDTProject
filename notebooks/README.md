## Note

These notebooks were used for:

- Prototyping and testing features
- Data exploration and analysis
- API integration testing
- Performance testing
- Proof of concept implementations

The production code has been refactored and properly organized into the main application structure. Please refer to the main application directories for the current implementation.

## Usage

These notebooks are not maintained and may not work with the current version of the application. They are kept for:

- Documentation purposes
- Understanding the development process
- Reference for future improvements

For the current implementation, please refer to the main application code.
